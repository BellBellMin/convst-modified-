- RDST Ensemble results : `CV_30_results_ensemble_no_bounds_no_prime_log.csv`
- RDST Ensemble results with prime dilation (faster but a bit less accurate): `CV_30_results_ensemble_no_bounds_prime_log.csv`
- Results of other algortihms : `all_resamples_average.csv`
- Old RDST Ensemble results (worse due to an unexpected normalization of the input time series) : `CV_30_results_ensemble.csv`

Timing results are inacurate for the first dataset, see issue#34 and issue#24
