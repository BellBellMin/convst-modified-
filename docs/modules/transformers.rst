The following sections will describe the main transformers that are available in the :mod:`convst.transformers` module.

Random Dilated Shapelet Transform (RDST)
----------------------------------------

The Random Dilated Shapelet Transform (RDST) algorithm, implemented by :class:`RDST` is 
an adaptation of time series shapelets which introduces in shapelets the notion of dilation usually used in convolutional kernels.
