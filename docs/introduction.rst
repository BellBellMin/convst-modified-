A time series is a sequence of values indexed in time order. Given their
nature, they are very common in many real-world applications. With the high
availability of sensors and the development of *Internet of things* devices,
the amount of time series data and the number of applications is continuously
increasing. Traditional domains using this type of data include finance and
econometrics, and these domains have recently been joined by smart grid,
earthquake prediction and weather forecasting.
